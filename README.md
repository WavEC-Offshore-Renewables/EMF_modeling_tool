<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This code was developed within the scope of WESE project, funded by the European Commission, which aims to increase the knowledge over the potential environmental effects of ocean energy projects. This specific piece of code, is part of the EMF modelling task, and aims to estimate the estimate the EMF radiated from operating subsea pwer cables used in offshore renewable energy projects.

It leverages significantly from the [Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM)](https://www.femm.info/) software package, a simple, low computational cost software package for solving electromagnetic projects using finite element method. Using it's python API,  a simple framework was develop to generating specific submarine cable designs, by adjusting relevant cable component dimensions, electromagnetic properties and electrical characteristics.Â
